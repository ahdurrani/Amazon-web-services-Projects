# Project Title

Low-Cost AWS Solution for Seamless Application Deployment and Data Management

## Project Overview

This project aims to provide a low-cost AWS solution to address the challenge of seamless application deployment and efficient data management. By leveraging various AWS services such as EC2, ELB, Route 53, RDS PostgreSQL, and S3 object storage, we have designed a scalable and resilient infrastructure setup.

## Key Features

- Deploy EC2 instances in two Availability Zones (AZs) for high availability and fault tolerance.
- Utilize ELB Application Load Balancer connected with Route 53 for seamless traffic distribution and DNS management.
- Automatic scaling of EC2 instances during peak times to handle high request loads without downtime.
- Fast application deployment using Code Pipeline for efficient continuous integration and delivery.
- Implement Multi-AZ deployment for RDS PostgreSQL to ensure data durability and facilitate disaster recovery.
- Safeguard data with S3, a cost-effective and durable object storage solution.
